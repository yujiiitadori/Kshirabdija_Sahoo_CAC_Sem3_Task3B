        <h1>Educational Challenges for Dalit Children in India</h1>
        <p>In the Indian educational system, Dalit children often face various forms of discrimination and exclusion, despite legal provisions and efforts to promote social equality and inclusivity. Many educational institutions continue to perpetuate biased practices and prejudices, affecting the educational experiences of Dalit children.</p>
        <p>1. Caste-Based Discrimination: Dalit children frequently encounter caste-based discrimination and bias from peers, educators, and the broader community, leading to exclusion, isolation, and a hostile learning environment.</p>
        <p>2. Lack of Access to Quality Education: Inadequate educational infrastructure, lack of resources, and unequal distribution of educational facilities disproportionately affect Dalit children, limiting their access to quality education and hindering their academic growth.</p>
        <p>3. Social Stigma and Prejudice: Deep-rooted social stigma and prejudices against Dalits often result in marginalization and limited opportunities for educational advancement, contributing to lower retention rates and higher dropout rates among Dalit students.</p>
        <p>4. Inadequate Policy Implementation: Despite the existence of affirmative action and policies to promote inclusivity, the inadequate implementation and enforcement of these policies contribute to the continued marginalization and educational disparities faced by Dalit children.</p>
        <p>5. Limited Economic Resources: Economic constraints and financial hardships often impede the educational progress of Dalit children, limiting their access to additional educational support, materials, and resources essential for holistic development.</p>
